// A Vite scaffold for building browser extensions and its corresponding tutorial, developed two years ago.

// A demo based on Slate.js, developed two years ago for learning rich text editors. Slate.js serves as the building blocks for developing rich text editors, requiring custom assembly. Recently, I have been attempting to refactor it using Tailwind CSS and TypeScript.

// I spent my holiday a month ago learning NestJS for backend development to better understand the frontend of a project that involves frontend-backend integration. The project is a music player that is still incomplete. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of interaction design and the challenges faced when collaborating with frontend developers, as I took on the responsibility of both interaction design and UI design myself.The frontend of this project uses Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, ShadCN, and Zustand.

// The backend of the previously mentioned project is implemented using NestJS and Prisma, with MySQL as the database. This experience helped me gain a better understanding of permission control in frontend-backend communication. I also developed my own understanding of best practices for backend API design. In this semester's school project, as the technical leader, I taught the backend team how to design standardized API interfaces. Additionally, I implemented an interesting API. When specific parameters are passed to this API, it can fetch audio files from video websites, rename them, and organize them into the static resources section of my server.
